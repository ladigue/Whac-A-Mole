## whacamole.js

A simple game using ~~**JQuery**~~ **D3** on **SVG** made for fun :)

_This project is in progress._

## About the project

As a graphic designer and a beginner in web development, I wanted to try the interactivity of svg as a game using Javascript.<br />
I started this using JQuery, but then I realised that JQuery wasn't appropriated for this kind of project, so I decided to retry this using D3.JS

## Installation
